Today is Feb 14th 2026

This is a prompt for Codex agentic AI to create a new project.
You are starting with a mostly blank project folder with just 3 files:
* INITIAL_PROMPT.md - this file
* IDEA.md - detailed description of the project
* JSON_SAMPLES.md - example output (more info in IDEA.md)
These 3 files are not to be changed by Codex agent.

After reading this prompt, continue with reading IDEA.md which is a detailed continuation of this prompt, and JSON_SAMPLES.md with example outputs you may find useful.

You are free to create and modify other new files in this folder a you see fit.
Every time you finish processing new prompt application runtime version will increase by +0.1 , and you will note the date and version with any changes into CHANGELOG.md that you will create. You are starting from version 0.1 and today's date. Versioning will include any changes you make, no matter how small, or ifi it targeted at the application code, documentation, or any other file or asset.

If you have any questions you can ask before continuing. Asking questions and getting replies does not count against iterating the version numbers.

You can start now.
